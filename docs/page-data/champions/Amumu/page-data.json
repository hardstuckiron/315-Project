Doomed by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generationsâ€”such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.","bannerImg":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":308,"height":560,"src":"/315-Project-2/static/e8aa6b7e84b240d1b1b3aa4adec9cf9f/a89a5/Amumu_0.jpg","srcSet":"/315-Project-2/static/e8aa6b7e84b240d1b1b3aa4adec9cf9f/a89a5/Amumu_0.jpg 1x"}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathName":"/champions/Amumu/"}}}
