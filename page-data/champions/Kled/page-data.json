He is an icon beloved by the empire's soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has “acquired” every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what's his… and to take whatever he can get.","bannerImg":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":308,"height":560,"src":"/static/a98bfb316d6e7aa55c36da1e01d0ece0/a89a5/Kled_0.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a98bfb316d6e7aa55c36da1e01d0ece0/a89a5/Kled_0.jpg 1x"}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathName":"/champions/Kled/"}}}
